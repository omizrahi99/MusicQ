Tech-stack: next.js

Description: This app will allow multiple people to queue songs to a group queue instead of having only one person play the music. It wouldn't be first in first out though, there will be a voting/ranking system that allows people to up/agree with other suggestions. The user who creates the room has the ability to share a code or link that allows other users to join. 
Goal: Listen to the most liked songs between your friends. 
Accomplish goal: using upvotes and downvotes 

  User Roles: 
  * admin: user who creates the room and controls what music is played 
  * users: others who can upvote and downvote

Things to look into: 
* spotify API vs embedding youtube music links 
* upvote downvote system for ranking songs
