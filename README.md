MusicQ

The user who creates the room has the ability to share a code or link that allows other users to join. 
Goal: Listen to the most liked songs between your friends. 
Accomplish goal: using upvotes and downvotes 

  User Roles: 
  * admin: user who creates the room and controls what music is played
