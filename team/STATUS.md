## Sprint Goal for Monday 04/27 through Monday 05/04

* Query songs and incorporate auth0
* See a dynamic list populated
* Connect users to a virtual room

## Brief description of MVP

Being able to query songs from the spotify api and see a dynamic list of these songs. The first song that is queued will begin to 
play. A shared room key allows multiple users to connect to a single virtual room. 

## Production App placeholder

(Enter a link here to your production app, e.g. <https://cs48-s20-s1-t1-prod.herokuapp.com/>)

(Then Enter only one of these)

* Team is on track to complete production app placeholder by noon Thursday (04/30/2020)

(If help is needed, specify here where the team is stuck.)

## MVP Status

(Enter only one of these)

What obstacles remain to completing MVP:
* Dynamically re-render queue of songs
* Real-time connection to a virtual room
* Figure out the redirect urls
* Query for songs using the spotify api

Support that would be helpful from course staff to completing MVP
