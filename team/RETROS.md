## Action item

a goal: 
* Focus on project and QA testing

a change: 
* first person who does the lab should let the team know on slack how many other people are needed to complete the lab
* deploy to QA often and share on slack so other people can test
* having people who aren't working on labs focus on the project

a measurement: 
* having more QA deploys and giving more feedback 

## Brief description of how retro went
* I used the "went well, to improve, and action items" format 
* I was glad that everyone had the chance to talk and shared something that they wanted to improve
* I should have gone over what the goal of the previous sprint was before asking about the previous sprint.

## Action item

a goal: 
* Look at Kanban and do non MVP items

a change: 
* better comments on code
* organizing folders
* speaking up if you want to work on something

a measurement: 
* discuss changes/progression from whenever we make weekly updates to when we do progess updates

## Brief description of how retro went
* I combined start/stop/coninue, "Learned" from the 4Ls, and "Goal" from Sailboat.
* I think it went well; everyone contributed a fair amount.
* There are moments when there is silence, having your own suggestions or extra questions is probably a good idea.

## Action item

a goal: each iteration of the app is functional and/or testable on its own 
* UI part/testable  
* backend

a change: constant communication on slack (ex: progress updates) - written standup
* commits/ commit messages
* research 
* progress specific to kanban board acceptance critera
* friday update 

a measurement: re-evaluate at next retro if this written slack updates are helpful 

## Retro Assessment

* I combined both the sailboat and 4Ls template.
* I think its went pretty well, at first it was a little slow but the discussion later picked up 
* Trying to get everyone to talk was kind of difficult, so if there are any questions you can ask each memeber or give each member some time to come up with stuff and then discuss it might help in getting everyone to talk.
